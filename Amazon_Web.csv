*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***

Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.

Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.

I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performance

Front and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.

Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.

Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.

Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.

Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.

Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average üòÜ but manageable if you have back cover.

Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.
Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.

I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.

Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.

As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.

If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.

But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.

In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.
I couldn't find a phone which has:

Super AmoLed Bright display.
6000 mAh battery.
OIS camera.
120hz Refresh Rate.
4 years of OS (stock Android like) updates
Decent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)
5G with several bands.

It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.

Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.

Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.

Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.

Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.

Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.

Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.

Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.

If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.

I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.

Overall a nice deal !"

I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.

( After 3 months am updating the review again below)

October Update: -
During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ‚Çπ14200 rs with card discount

My requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.

Cons or Disadvantages: -
1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)

2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.

3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic. Using Snapchat filter for good selfie
One more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.
Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile camera
Back camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there

4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available
5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .
After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds

6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respond

No more cons I found till date. I ll update later.

Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )

2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it

3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.

4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)
Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.

5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug in

Suggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.

If your priorities is display and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )

Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)

Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‚ÄòHonest Review ‚Äô upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.

Thank you...‚ù§Ô∏è"

this is Sourya Gourab,
today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......
üëâ... PROS ...üëà
‚ñ™Ô∏è1) CAMERA:- the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .üëç
‚ñ™Ô∏è 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....üëç but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...ü§î honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.
‚ñ™Ô∏è3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thingüî•ü•∞. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure FolderüìÅ etc. Samsung Knoxüîí is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung üòçüòçüòç
‚ñ™Ô∏è4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot üî• Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue üòäüòäit's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.
üëâ Yes!! sometimes it feels warmüî• in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad üòä. ‚Çπ14999/- is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......üëçüëçüëç
‚ñ™Ô∏è5) BATTERYüîã:- 6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.
But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.üëç prevent background running of apps etc.....
‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èüëâ... CON'S ...üëà‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è
‚ñ™Ô∏è6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also highüìà. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damagesüòÖ in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!! KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
2:) Phone has slightly warmüå° issue on its back side....also Slightly Heatüî• during charging.....üòê but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG üòáüòáüòá
SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....
I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ‚ù§Ô∏è. Regards

The color midnight blue looks absolutely stunning. Very easy to setup and seamless data transferring from the old device.
The size of the phone is handy and not too big or small, I would the perfect size.
For the display all I need to say is that it is a Samsung display. Such a vibrant and good looking display, love it.
Didn't face any kind of lag or stuttering, the ram management is also pretty good.
The cameras too are pretty decent, daylight photography would yield good photos and in night the quality would go down but still so much better than other phones in this segment. Loved the cameras too üí•
The updates too are amazing, 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of security updates.
Speakers are loud too, with a decent amount of bass and clarity.
5g works well if you live in a metropolitan area, where 5g is available throughout.
The phone feels sturdy and durable.

Now why not 5 stars...
1) the phone gets hot, use too much camera the phone will get hot, use the phone for a really long time 3-4 hours it will get hot even in the winters.
2) the design is not the latest but will suffice. Still Samsung should have given a punch hole display."

Pros-
1.Its good for people with concern of battery backup as it has 1.5 to 2 day backup.

2.You should prefer 8gb 128gb minimum variant as there will be 4 OS updates and to handle that 8gb minimum ram should be required.

3.Also, camera quality is good and on top of that 120 hz Amoled Full Hd+ display is top notch.

Cons-
1. Not suitable for high end gaming , you can play games but not at highest graphics , standard graphics is preferred.

2.Some time get overheated due to excessive gaming or playing at high resoluion.

3. Fingerprint sensor is not that fast but decent."

Have also purchased A7 & A10 for a family member. I was looking to buy a mid range phone and this is one of the best phones in mid range prices with 4 Android and 5 yrs security updates. Samsung is known for a good display and awesome cameras however this device scores low as per my expectations. Another plus is powerful battery which lasts for more than a day if the usage is normal. One of the BIGGEST drawback, it's heavy and thicker as compared to the current generation of smartphones and may discourage buyers. So if you are looking for lighter and thinner phones, this may not be the right phone for you."

Size feels big but it is normal these days all smartphone have almost same size. Touce responce is good 120hz feel super smooth don't swith to 60hz it kills the smoothness. I don't know about Durabitity , samsung promise for 4yrs os update but i don't think it can handle it. Battery is not so good it takes around 1hr 30 min(25w official charger) to full charge and gives around 6 to 7 hr (5g and 120hz enabled) screen on time."

OIS Camera is better than other phones at this price. But not good as s21 fe and apple 7 plus. Broken Pixels are seen on zoom in pics. Video recording is good one.
2. 6000mah battery is best if you disable 5g connectivity. M34 uses 5nm processor which consumes less battery. Charging takes around 2 hours 20 minutes.
3. Worth at 15k price. No difference is seen between 120hz and 60hz refresh rate."

1.Battery life is good. Easily works whole day with high usage.
2.Security and updates are good
3.Audio quality is good .

Cons:
1. Very heavy in weight
2. Very bad ,literally pathetic selfie ( front) camera
3.If you have used xiomi, redmi or oppo or any other phones in the past ,you will miss their camera and video quality. Very bad video quality.
4.Hear echo on calls most of the times.
6. No charger and dont get good back covers for this phone in market.

Overall very average phone. Regret buying this at 22000 ."

But has a lagging problem. A bit slow. Overall üëç üëå. But after using one plus ull fell the samsung is slow. May be because of the processer. But thebpho is good. Touch also is a bit slow. Compact in size. But very slippery... good for people who likes samsung.. it's a good phone. 8gb ram still slowüôÜüôÜ maybe afer the update it mite get better..

Pros

Let's First talk about camera and screen the main highlights of screen
They all appreciated camera alot but it's not even close to hype gives yellowish tone to each photo like a cheap smartphone not eyepleasing at all
Display is good acc to price but you can tell the difference only when put side to side with another smartphone otherwise all display gives similar view in this price range
So not worth buying only for display

Now price i bought it for 15000
So I should be comparing it with other 15000rs smartphones but not you should go for Smartphone around 17000 because 15000‚Çπ for smartphone + 1500 for charger + 200 cover and screen guard= 16700 ( other brands give all this with smartphone)

So all the best things about this phone camera display price , in actual are not that good all this is gimmick so only buy this phone for your parents who doesn't have long screentime as it has big battery, 4 years of updates

Cons
Took 2 hours too charge that's is way too long
Processor is not that good as you already know
Not worth the price there are better option in less price
Ugly drop notch chin ( though Mobile looks good you may call somewhat premium if chin is ignored)

If you are getting this with charger under 15k and not that fond of gaming and whitish photos ( pictures that makes you look fair) then you can go for it"

1. Battery? Yes. 6000 mah. Will comfortably work for 36+ hrs. SOT(about 10 hrs). It has Battery protect feature. More than enough.
2. Display? 120 hz super amoled. More than enough.
3. Software? One UI 5.1 flagship level. All features and customization available. With good lock you get everything. Android 13 out of the box.
4. Updates? 4 years OS + 5 years security. More than enough
5. Knox security.
6. Samsung wallet with nfc.
7. Simple. Durable.
8. If you compare with other Chinese phones, goes are assembled phone. But Samsung has its own chipset(not the best one), camera sensors(good), display(very good) hence these very well co-ordinated.
9. I almost forgot, camera is good.
10. Phone is not for pro gamers.
11. No heating."

Phone seems to stutter rarely not so frequent can be ignored. If you set your expectations in check then this won't disappoint you. There are few bloatwares of samsung but most of them can be uninstalled, rest can be disabled. Buy this if you don't want any other unreliable company's phone.

Promised software support is a bit ambitious but lets see how it keeps up with time, as of now updates are not that frequent."

Don't buy if you are gamer, 4k Video watcher on youtube.
But if you are scroller of instagram, facebook and lite gaming.
Then it's good
Camera is good
Not best
Inflation affects a lot.
So, Buy only 8GB+256GB variant because hybrid simslot and no esim support buy 8GB+256GB which only make sense.
Samsung please give us charger also
1k for charger it's a huge price.
And don't go with the number game.
Also try offline for look and feel, then decide buy offline or online."

In my experience it is a great phone,

Connectivity- 5G is stable I tested with Airtel 5g and speed is awesome.

Heating- No heating issue

Performence- Phone performs smoothly in all apps. Sometimes jitters at the time of heavy multitasking. This phone is not for high end gaming

Camera- The best camera under 20k

Battery - Battery is 6000 mah but it feels like 5000, It's okay normal.

Display- No comparison in display, it's awesome

One ui- The full one ui is so much usefully in daily office tasks. It packs uncountable features for you.

Conclusion- If you are not a gamer and your budget is under 20k than don't think anything go for it."

It has a very crisp 120 hz super amoled display which pops every content that you watch in this mobile. The battery backup was not that great for 6000 mah( maybe because 5g consumes more battery than in a 4g network) , for me it would give only one day of backup after heavily using it. The charging speed is also very great. Charges 1 to 100 in less than a hour. The processesor is not meant for gaming and gets a little heatted up while multitasking.

* Gaming phone
* High performance phone

Performs day to day tasks with ease and may be basic gaming.

Call quality is decent.

What is Good:
* Amoled display
* Dolby Atmos
* HIGHLY OPTIMISED phone - so battery lasts longer not just because of bigger battery.
* 6000 Mah battery - Depending upon usage, it can easily last 1.5 day and upto 2 days
* Decent camera
* Few bloatware
* 4yrs OS update and 5 yrs security update (but not sure if the phone can handle 3rd or the 4th OS update)
* Screen brightess is Good and viewable under direct sunlight.
* No in screen finger print scanner - Meaning if for some reason you have to replace the screen, it will be slightly less expensive. Amoled screens with fingerprint scanner will cost you half your phones price

What to expect:
* From time to time you may notice slowness/lag - If you have too many apps installed
* Not intended for high memory utilizing apps
* Slight Heating issues from time to time
* Slow charging if you don't use Samsung fast charger. Tried 33W fast charger - charging is still slow.
* May not be able to handle Android OS 15 or later updates
* Videos can be viewed at maximum resolution of 1080P. Does not support 1220p or 1440P.
* Has only single stereo speaker
* It's better not to charge the phone when it's hot, charging will be slow even with Samsung charger.

Note: It's an old chipset known for heating issues. The same chipset was used in Samsung M33. The only reason it works well, is because the OS is highly optimised.

The phone is for those users:
a) Who performs basic to medium tasks/activities.
b) Stable phone with regular OS updates and security patches
c) Intends to use the phone for 3+yrs

If you do decide to buy this phone, I would recommend you to go with 8GB ram else go for something else.

(Going great even after 4 years..)

M34 is slightly bulkier, slightly bigger also in size. Decent camera and speakers, battery also good for a days heavy use (not speaking for gamers). If using screen lightly then possibly can use for upto 2 days on a full charge..

Says amoled and gorilla glass but I don't see any perceptible improvement from my M30 screen quality. (I think that impressive screen quality comes a bit more expensive.., I will definitely pay a bit more for a screen which I got with samsung galaxy S3)

A slight change I will need adjusting to is side finger print rather than in the back..but these days face recognition is good enough for most purposes..

Samsung switch is great for moving your old phone data and settings to new one- almost magic. Apart from a few restricted app data (banks, whatsapp etc) everything else was copied (app, data, settings..) within 30 minutes. Including google account for android, contacts, call history and sms! Email clients are copied and only thing I need is to login once to every account to start using it.

After the transfer both my phones were carbon copy of each other- down to even my screensaver and widget placement etc, every single app was on the same page, convenient!
Just connect phones c to c and follow instructions..(transfer Old to New)

I bought a 25 watt samsung original charger also but not required, my M30 original charger (15 watt or less I think) is working perfectly..

Just to get a great combo, go for samsung buds (<4k) instead of any other bluetooth earphones. Great value for money..

Mine is 8gb/128gb version. Not yet used heavily (still using old phone for most purposes, transition will take some time..specially since the M30 is still perfect like new). So, things like heating on heavy uses etc will realise only later..though my experience with samsung is they are better on that front..

M30 was 4 gb memory and used an average 2 gb most of the times. I have been a bit liberal with app installation (installed a few suggested apps, not many though) and permissions on new phone and it uses 4 gb plus most of ther time, though it should be able to control that a bit with proper app management. But don't expect a 2 gb memory use despite minimum app install etc..5g, Nfc, android 13, and few other things combined would keep minimum close to 4gb

M30 had 2 dedicated sim plus sd card slot. This has just 1 dedicated sim, and other slot you can use either for sim or sd card. Should work for most, specially since you have 128gb storage as standard, so sd card not required

Jio will give you unlimited 5g data as soon as you move to 5g so that will be a big saving. You can now opt for cheapest plan and still use unlimited 5g data till jio promotion continues..including mobile hotspot uses..

5g is perceptibly fast..

Got it for 20k with 2k offer from axis bank card

Overall, go for it if you are looking for a dependable upto 20k 5g mobile"

I bought this phone from Amazon Great Indian Festival Sale. This cost me ‚Çπ15999 + ‚Çπ999 (Samsung Adapter 25w) and it came to ‚Çπ16998.

PROS: ‚óè It has latest Android version is 13 (now 14 has also been released on 4 Oct).
‚óè One UI 5.1 which gives a new experience on phones with larger screens, it provides widget features and also gives shortcut keys.
‚óè The display is good and it also comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 which is scratchproof.
‚óè It also supports 4K videos at 30fps.
‚óè It has Exynos 1280 chip, which makes the gaming experience better. Rest of the performance is also good.
‚óè Camera features are amazing, SLO-Mo and Super Slo-Mo, HD and FHD, Pro Camera and a new Fun feature which is related to Snapchat.
‚óè There are 3 or 4 ways to take a screenshot but the best is to set the screenshot icon on the screen which works like one touch screenshot.
‚óè It has 128GB storage and 6GB RAM.
‚óè Unlike Redmi and Realme, unnecessary notifications do not come again and again, you can also control them.

CONS: ‚óè Battery is 6000mah, but its life is short.
‚óè Exynos is a good chipset but it is pale in comparison to Snapdragon and it also drains the battery.
‚óè Main Camera is 50 MP which is good but Front Camera is 13 MP which is quite bad, if you are a selfie lover then you will be disappointed.
‚óè Samsung File Manager does not allow access to Android folders, so you may need to download a third party File Manager app.
‚óè Like Redmi and Realme, it does not have the feature of App Lock.
‚óè Connectivity is a little slow, it takes a few seconds to turn on mobile data."

I am using Galaxy M34 from last 10 days. So I am sharing my current experience and will let you know if anything different happens in the future. And I am Not a heavy user so it can be different for you...
1. Camera = 4/5
Camera is decent not too good as i expected maybe Samsung would fix it by updates..
2. Battery = 5/5
Real Monster,,,, just wow i am impressed with the battery backup i am a moderate phone user,, So for me a full charge is sufficient for 2 days.
Charging speed with original Samsung 25w charger it takes around 1 hours 20 mins to get fully charged
3. Display = 5/5
Samsung sAmoled display is always better, so for watching content it's great.
4. Build and look = 4/5
Looks premium but scratches and fingerprints are easily visible.
5. Performance = 4/5
We all know this is not a performance phone, but it does our daily tasks comfortably. and i feel little warm initially. so Don't expect flawless Gaming.
6. Sounds and Speaker = 4/5
Not a stereo speaker but Single speaker is good enough in terms of loudness..
7. UI and Software = 5/5
One ui with knox security. It gives a very good experience. In terms of UI, I don't find any phone better than Samsung.. and Samsung has kept unique features like Samsung wallet secure folder in this phone. With 4 Gen of Os And 5 years Of security update ..

So in the end I would like to say this. For me there is no major drawback till now in this phone... I Hope it would be helpful for you..."

7- touch censors are really of very high quality this time round which is also a added bonus

8- And many Samsung features which is a plus point with NFC enabled which others phones don't offer

I saw many negative reviews on the review section and a bit worried to order. Since I had faith in Samsung products, I ordered this phone and got it delivered the next day. I am writing this review after using for a week. It does not overheat as many complained. I am a basic user installed only required apps and no gaming apps. It works faster and has many features which needs time to learn and use it. Camera Quality is good for this price. it supports true 5G means, the speed can be up to 1mbps. Thank you Seller and Thank you Samsung for making me afford this phone (Samsung M34 5G)"

It charged sufficiently fast though. The Super AmoLED display is smooth and the graphic colors are good with the display sharp and crisp. I'm not a gamer and hence will not comment on its gaming performance. The front and rear OIS camera photos are natural but a tad lower in clarity and quality than my previous phone Samsung Galaxy M21. The speakers on the contrary produce crisp clear sound to stand out. As Samsung has promised four years of Android OS updates, I opted for the 8 GB RAM. With a120Hz refresh rate, this 5G phone is overall a good buy at this price range."

The large AMOLED screen with its vibrant colors and impressive resolution brings my content to life in ways I never thought possible. Whether I'm watching movies or simply browsing the web, the immersive visuals make every activity a joy.

Performance-wise, the Samsung M34 5G is an absolute powerhouse. The combination of a robust processor, ample RAM, and optimized software results in smooth and snappy performance across the board. Apps launch in an instant, and multitasking is effortless, even when juggling multiple resource-intensive applications.

The camera system on the Samsung M34 5G is a photography enthusiast's dream. The advanced sensors and intelligent software algorithms consistently capture stunning images with impeccable detail and color accuracy. From well-lit landscapes to challenging low-light situations, this smartphone delivers outstanding results every time.

One of the standout features for me is the battery life. Despite its powerful performance and energy-intensive 5G capabilities, the Samsung M34 5G manages to keep up with my busy lifestyle effortlessly. I can go through an entire day of heavy usage without worrying about constantly needing to recharge.

The sleek and modern design of the Samsung M34 5G is the icing on the cake. The slim profile, premium materials, and attention to detail showcase Samsung's commitment to both aesthetics and functionality. Holding this phone in my hand feels like holding a piece of the future.

Speakers are sharp and well-built which produce sharp sound quality.
Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Good those who are comfortable in side-mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.

As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.

I couldn't find a phone which has:
Super Amoled Bright display.
6000 mAh battery.
50MP OIS camera.
120hz Refresh Rate.
4 years of OS updates
Decent chipset for multi-tasking.
5G with several bands.

In conclusion, the Samsung M34 5G is an absolute marvel of technology and innovation. It's redefined what I expect from a smartphone, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. From its lightning-fast 5G connectivity and stunning display to its top-tier performance and exceptional camera capabilities, the Samsung M34 5G truly raises the bar for what a smartphone can achieve. If you're looking for a device that seamlessly integrates into your connected lifestyle and delivers an unparalleled user experience, look no further than the Samsung M34 5G."

Back Camera is very good. We can record 60fps video in FHD mode and 30fps in UHD. Both Video and photo have pro features and performing good in low light also and colouring is very natural. Also front and macro camera is good. Battery backup is also very fine since it has a 5nm processor and 6000mah capacity. No lag in processor for normal usage, I think exynos 1280 is a good processor for an allrounder. No much heating issues compared to snapdragon processors. Fingerprints reading is really fast and accurate even if it is side mounted. Sound recording is really great and the output speaker volume is really high and have some good bass coming out which is pleasant to our ears. But the vibration from the speaker can be felt on our hands. Display is amazing with 120hz refresh rate. OS have improved a lot and gives about 80% features given in a flagship model.

Cons are mostly lookwise: Waterdrop notch, outdated design, hybrid slot which we have no dedicated sd card slot,either dual sim can be used or one sim and sd card at a time.

It's just 1 day after buy review and will update after further usage."

Pros: -
1. 6000 mAh battery üîã will last upto 1¬Ω day if you're a heavy user otherwise it will give backup of 2 days for normal user.

2. Display is sAmoled‚ù§Ô∏è and it's gorgeous at this price with 120hz refresh rate. I'm comfortable with u shaped notch. It's your personal choice you love it, or you don't.

3. 4 years of OS update üòé it matters for me. And it has Full One UI does not core version, so you'll get maximum features of One UI except some like Samsung Desk.
4. Main camera is best. I switched from Redmi Note 5 Pro after using it more than 5 years so it's better than Redmi üòÖ. I'm not a camera focused person. So, ignore meüòÄ. You can be able to record videos from main camera at 4k@30fps max but if you want stabilization then to use 1080@60fps for better results.

5. Exynos 1280 is good i use it extensively and it didn't heat much as compared to Exynos 2100 of s21fe. I didn't face any battery drain or anything.

6. UI is smooth across any app. You'll get 120fps in each app.

Cons: -

1. Back side is fingerprint magnet see in photo. üòê You must clean regular but is prism colour is awesome üòç

2.Due to ufs 2.2 you will feel lag and jitter in multitasking.

3. RAM management isn't good. üò≠

4.You didn't get a charger you'll have to buy it @‚Çπ1k approx. I buy Samsung original charger at @‚Çπ938.

5. It take 1-1.5hr to charge but it's not big matter for me but for many ‚ò∫Ô∏è

6. Face recognition didn't work well. Sometimes it didn't recognise meüò≠.

Conclusion: -

For me it's best at this price i get because it has everything i want üôè I use NFC and it works fine. Samsung wallet ‚ù§Ô∏è and more. I'm not a
heavy gamer so i didn't face any issue but i try bgmi and trust me this phone isn't for gamer's ü•π. But the package offers a lot at this price i love it. Thank you, Samsung for launching this monster at this price. üòòüòòüòò"

Harry J,B0C7C1DRK5,Reviewed in India on 30 July 2023,5.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFG5KL2XL5AOLNQ6WC3LYDSCIUWA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,My first Samsung handset - buy it,"Before lockdown Samsung would sell similar product at maximum 15K and the box would have charger, back cover included and with bank discount, the handset used to cost around 13k.

This device has printed mrp of 24000‚Çπ, and is sold at 18999‚Çπ with hdfc bank discount of 2000‚Çπ

Let me start by cons

1. Box does not have charger and you need to shell out extra 1200‚Çπ for Samsung branded charger so it increases cost to around 21000‚Çπ without bank discount - now I have no idea what environment are they caring about but it's just a ploy to earn more cash from consumers - the charger comes packed in box and that is absolutely not nice thing to do Samsung.

2. The phone has plastic back. It feels fragile.

Pros

1. It has almost all sensors and this is good.

2. Super Amoled screen at this price is welcome.

3. Thankfully no major bloat ware apps except for Samsungs few offerings

4. Didn't test the camera but it would be ok at this price point.

5. Thankfully it has nfc which is almost absent in similar configuration handsets by other manufacturers. So now spend more by tap to pay üòÅ

6. The os too will get updates for 4 years and hopefully let's assume the hardware will last that long without requiring replacements üôè

Finally I request Samsung to price it properly so that more people can buy it - the ideal price without charger should be max 14000‚Çπ"

*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***

Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.

Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.

I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performance

Front and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.

Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.

Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.

Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.

Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.

Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average üòÜ but manageable if you have back cover.

Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.
Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.

I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.

Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.

As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.

If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.

But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.

In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.
I couldn't find a phone which has:

Super AmoLed Bright display.
6000 mAh battery.
OIS camera.
120hz Refresh Rate.
4 years of OS (stock Android like) updates
Decent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)
5G with several bands.

It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.

Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.

Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.

Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.

Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.

Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.

Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.

Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.

If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.

I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.

Overall a nice deal !"

I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.

( After 3 months am updating the review again below)

October Update: -
During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ‚Çπ14200 rs with card discount

My requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.

Cons or Disadvantages: -
1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)

2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.

3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic. Using Snapchat filter for good selfie
One more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.
Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile camera
Back camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there

4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available
5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .
After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds

6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respond

No more cons I found till date. I ll update later.

Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )

2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it

3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.

4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)
Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.

5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug in

Suggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.

If your priorities is display and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )

Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)

Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‚ÄòHonest Review ‚Äô upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.

Sourya Gourab Nanda,B0C7C1DRK5,Reviewed in India on 12 October 2023,4.0 out of 5 stars,https://www.amazon.in/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH4ZKLE2CCNYF2Q5PYDROKKXGFYA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8,Best Phone in ‚Çπ14999/- on Amazon Sale‚ù§Ô∏è Love it.,"Hello!!
this is Sourya Gourab,
today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......
üëâ... PROS ...üëà
‚ñ™Ô∏è1) CAMERA:- the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .üëç
‚ñ™Ô∏è 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....üëç but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...ü§î honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.
‚ñ™Ô∏è3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thingüî•ü•∞. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure FolderüìÅ etc. Samsung Knoxüîí is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung üòçüòçüòç
‚ñ™Ô∏è4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot üî• Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue üòäüòäit's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.
üëâ Yes!! sometimes it feels warmüî• in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad üòä. ‚Çπ14999/- is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......üëçüëçüëç
‚ñ™Ô∏è5) BATTERYüîã:- 6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.
But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.üëç prevent background running of apps etc.....
‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èüëâ... CON'S ...üëà‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è
‚ñ™Ô∏è6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also highüìà. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damagesüòÖ in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!! KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
2:) Phone has slightly warmüå° issue on its back side....also Slightly Heatüî• during charging.....üòê but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG üòáüòáüòá
SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....
I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ‚ù§Ô∏è. Regards

The color midnight blue looks absolutely stunning. Very easy to setup and seamless data transferring from the old device.
The size of the phone is handy and not too big or small, I would the perfect size.
For the display all I need to say is that it is a Samsung display. Such a vibrant and good looking display, love it.
Didn't face any kind of lag or stuttering, the ram management is also pretty good.
The cameras too are pretty decent, daylight photography would yield good photos and in night the quality would go down but still so much better than other phones in this segment. Loved the cameras too üí•
The updates too are amazing, 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of security updates.
Speakers are loud too, with a decent amount of bass and clarity.
5g works well if you live in a metropolitan area, where 5g is available throughout.
The phone feels sturdy and durable.

Now why not 5 stars...
1) the phone gets hot, use too much camera the phone will get hot, use the phone for a really long time 3-4 hours it will get hot even in the winters.
2) the design is not the latest but will suffice. Still Samsung should have given a punch hole display."

Pros-
1.Its good for people with concern of battery backup as it has 1.5 to 2 day backup.

2.You should prefer 8gb 128gb minimum variant as there will be 4 OS updates and to handle that 8gb minimum ram should be required.

3.Also, camera quality is good and on top of that 120 hz Amoled Full Hd+ display is top notch.

Cons-
1. Not suitable for high end gaming , you can play games but not at highest graphics , standard graphics is preferred.

2.Some time get overheated due to excessive gaming or playing at high resoluion.

3. Fingerprint sensor is not that fast but decent."

Have also purchased A7 & A10 for a family member. I was looking to buy a mid range phone and this is one of the best phones in mid range prices with 4 Android and 5 yrs security updates. Samsung is known for a good display and awesome cameras however this device scores low as per my expectations. Another plus is powerful battery which lasts for more than a day if the usage is normal. One of the BIGGEST drawback, it's heavy and thicker as compared to the current generation of smartphones and may discourage buyers. So if you are looking for lighter and thinner phones, this may not be the right phone for you."

Size feels big but it is normal these days all smartphone have almost same size. Touce responce is good 120hz feel super smooth don't swith to 60hz it kills the smoothness. I don't know about Durabitity , samsung promise for 4yrs os update but i don't think it can handle it. Battery is not so good it takes around 1hr 30 min(25w official charger) to full charge and gives around 6 to 7 hr (5g and 120hz enabled) screen on time."

OIS Camera is better than other phones at this price. But not good as s21 fe and apple 7 plus. Broken Pixels are seen on zoom in pics. Video recording is good one.
2. 6000mah battery is best if you disable 5g connectivity. M34 uses 5nm processor which consumes less battery. Charging takes around 2 hours 20 minutes.
3. Worth at 15k price. No difference is seen between 120hz and 60hz refresh rate."

1.Battery life is good. Easily works whole day with high usage.
2.Security and updates are good
3.Audio quality is good .

Cons:
1. Very heavy in weight
2. Very bad ,literally pathetic selfie ( front) camera
3.If you have used xiomi, redmi or oppo or any other phones in the past ,you will miss their camera and video quality. Very bad video quality.
4.Hear echo on calls most of the times.
6. No charger and dont get good back covers for this phone in market.

Overall very average phone. Regret buying this at 22000 ."

1. Battery? Yes. 6000 mah. Will comfortably work for 36+ hrs. SOT(about 10 hrs). It has Battery protect feature. More than enough.
2. Display? 120 hz super amoled. More than enough.
3. Software? One UI 5.1 flagship level. All features and customization available. With good lock you get everything. Android 13 out of the box.
4. Updates? 4 years OS + 5 years security. More than enough
5. Knox security.
6. Samsung wallet with nfc.
7. Simple. Durable.
8. If you compare with other Chinese phones, goes are assembled phone. But Samsung has its own chipset(not the best one), camera sensors(good), display(very good) hence these very well co-ordinated.
9. I almost forgot, camera is good.
10. Phone is not for pro gamers.
11. No heating."

Phone seems to stutter rarely not so frequent can be ignored. If you set your expectations in check then this won't disappoint you. There are few bloatwares of samsung but most of them can be uninstalled, rest can be disabled. Buy this if you don't want any other unreliable company's phone.

Promised software support is a bit ambitious but lets see how it keeps up with time, as of now updates are not that frequent."

Don't buy if you are gamer, 4k Video watcher on youtube.

Camera is good
Not best
Inflation affects a lot.
So, Buy only 8GB+256GB variant because hybrid simslot and no esim support buy 8GB+256GB which only make sense.
Samsung please give us charger also
1k for charger it's a huge price.

1-Not a gaming phone... decent play over bgmi
2-No app lock, net speed view, and other handy features
3-Network issue feels sometimes.. while same sim on Chinese brand or apple works fine... I faced no. Not reachable or switched off while it shows full on network ...

In my experience it is a great phone,

Connectivity- 5G is stable I tested with Airtel 5g and speed is awesome.

Heating- No heating issue

Performence- Phone performs smoothly in all apps. Sometimes jitters at the time of heavy multitasking. This phone is not for high end gaming

Camera- The best camera under 20k

Battery - Battery is 6000 mah but it feels like 5000, It's okay normal.

Display- No comparison in display, it's awesome

One ui- The full one ui is so much usefully in daily office tasks. It packs uncountable features for you.

Conclusion- If you are not a gamer and your budget is under 20k than don't think anything go for it."

* Doesn't support VoNR, which is also a con.
* Doesn't has charger in the box and neither stereo speaker.

* Side mounted fingerprint, which works properly, and it justified in this price point.

It has a very crisp 120 hz super amoled display which pops every content that you watch in this mobile. The battery backup was not that great for 6000 mah( maybe because 5g consumes more battery than in a 4g network) , for me it would give only one day of backup after heavily using it. The charging speed is also very great. Charges 1 to 100 in less than a hour. The processesor is not meant for gaming and gets a little heatted up while multitasking. Faced network issue once in a week but not very often but if you face this issue you can just change network mode.( because its common in 5g phones)."

Pros

Let's First talk about camera and screen the main highlights of screen
They all appreciated camera alot but it's not even close to hype gives yellowish tone to each photo like a cheap smartphone not eyepleasing at all
Display is good acc to price but you can tell the difference only when put side to side with another smartphone otherwise all display gives similar view in this price range
So not worth buying only for display

Now price i bought it for 15000
So I should be comparing it with other 15000rs smartphones but not you should go for Smartphone around 17000 because 15000‚Çπ for smartphone + 1500 for charger + 200 cover and screen guard= 16700 ( other brands give all this with smartphone)

So all the best things about this phone camera display price , in actual are not that good all this is gimmick so only buy this phone for your parents who doesn't have long screentime as it has big battery, 4 years of updates

Cons
Took 2 hours too charge that's is way too long
Processor is not that good as you already know
Not worth the price there are better option in less price
Ugly drop notch chin ( though Mobile looks good you may call somewhat premium if chin is ignored)

If you are getting this with charger under 15k and not that fond of gaming and whitish photos ( pictures that makes you look fair) then you can go for it"

But the delivery person couldn't delivered it. He gave one ring missed call at 10 pm and put attempted in delivery status on oct 12 and oct 14 also.

* Gaming phone
* High performance phone

Performs day to day tasks with ease and may be basic gaming.

Call quality is decent.

What is Good:
* Amoled display
* Dolby Atmos
* HIGHLY OPTIMISED phone - so battery lasts longer not just because of bigger battery.
* 6000 Mah battery - Depending upon usage, it can easily last 1.5 day and upto 2 days
* Decent camera
* Few bloatware
* 4yrs OS update and 5 yrs security update (but not sure if the phone can handle 3rd or the 4th OS update)
* Screen brightess is Good and viewable under direct sunlight.
* No in screen finger print scanner - Meaning if for some reason you have to replace the screen, it will be slightly less expensive. Amoled screens with fingerprint scanner will cost you half your phones price

What to expect:
* From time to time you may notice slowness/lag - If you have too many apps installed
* Not intended for high memory utilizing apps
* Slight Heating issues from time to time
* Slow charging if you don't use Samsung fast charger. Tried 33W fast charger - charging is still slow.
* May not be able to handle Android OS 15 or later updates
* Videos can be viewed at maximum resolution of 1080P. Does not support 1220p or 1440P.
* Has only single stereo speaker
* It's better not to charge the phone when it's hot, charging will be slow even with Samsung charger.

Note: It's an old chipset known for heating issues. The same chipset was used in Samsung M33. The only reason it works well, is because the OS is highly optimised.

The phone is for those users:
a) Who performs basic to medium tasks/activities.
b) Stable phone with regular OS updates and security patches
c) Intends to use the phone for 3+yrs

If you do decide to buy this phone, I would recommend you to go with 8GB ram else go for something else.

It seems like a great phone with so many features, a lot them I may never even use. But for the gadget freak, these may thrill. I like the clarity and response of the screen, the camera and the battery life. What I don't like are the weight of the phone and the fact that the cameras juts out by a few mm, making is absolutely necessary to have a case, which makes it even more bulky that it already is..

The only positive sides are - (1) 8 GB memory (earlier I had 6 GB memory), (2) 5G instead of 4G, and (3) 6000 MaH battery (earlier I had 5000 MaH).

The phone has serious design flaw.

(1)The fingerprint scanner is at the side of the phone instead of on-screen. I bought a back-cover for the phone and now the fingerprint scanner is totally covered by the back cover. I am facing extreme difficulty in logging in to my secure apps and office apps.

(2) The sim tray can accommodate either 2 sim cards, or 1 sim card and 1 memory card. In my earlier phone - Galaxy A71, I could insert 2 sims and 1 memory card in one tray. That is gone now.

(3) The phone does not even support e-sim feature. This is now very common in every phone in this price segment.

(4) Overheating. It heats up even when I put it on charging.

Overall, I feel my money is not well utilized."

I m rating this product after using a month. Phone works smooth without any issues as of now.

Rear Camera is good, and front would be better at this price, could have been 16mp instead 13mp.
As usual Samsung use the exonys, and the phone is little weight (202 gms)
I'm not sure, why samsung stopped providing charger along with the phone which costs an additional 1K in buying, whereas all competitors providing the charger along with phone"

1. Screen size is small it just 6.5 inch in this price segment many big display are present
2.6000 mah battery is good but charging with 25W charger will take u about 1hr 50 minute
And charger is not there on the pack so u have to buy it it will cost 1000 additional
3.water notch is not good in this price segment it should give centre or side hole punch camera
4.samsumg ui is just very normal no fancy things unlike compared to realme or oneplus ui
5.4k downloaded movie play but it hang very much
6.and in youtube u can only play 1080p max.quality and no hdr support
But u will Ask why I bought this phone when it has so many issue because samsung is a brand that we can trust compared to others and many minor bugs which are occurring in the phone can be fixed by software update which they are promising for 4 year"

# Don't believe tech review most of the cases.
M34 not so good as much as the tech creater's create hype.

# Camera quality not so good, so so type 16/20mp in default settings. In zooming to much noice in pic.

# Exynos cheepset not so bad in normal use. Little bit heating in charging & long time uses . It is normal for every phone.

# Big issue in battery drain , I'm a normal user ,not a gamer, most time I use sosal media & YouTube but battery drain so quickly. I charge the phone twice a day in protect battery mode uses .
# This phone have 6000mah battery but backup looks like 4000mah. Samsung need a software update for solving this issue.

# One UI too much heavy, I use 8 gb version but ph most of the time shows 2.5 to 2.7 free space. Samsung need work on it & reduce the RAM management issue. If any one buy 6 gb version that person face too much lagging issue."

But actually 5g is not supported upto the time I write this review. I contacte d jio customer care and the response was that this device does not support 5g. Again, I contacted samsung customer care and their response was very bad and they spoke irresponsible. It is a waste phone I should say in case of 5g reception.

Second thing is that, even though this device have amoled panel, its quality is very low. Under the sunlight, when display brightness increase, the colours on the display gets faded.

Thirdly, samsung claimed that most of the flagship features of the one UI is included in this device. But I couldn't find even many of the features I was using in my galaxy a50.

Fourth, the camera is that perfect. Low light pictures are very poor

So, if you are planning to purchase a galaxy M34 5g, think twice before that.

I was trusting samsung, but this time they disappointed."

The device performance is just average nothing interesting to mention in the mobile except mobile display.
1. Processor can only handle daily activities.
In regular tasks also the device sometimes gets delay to respond.
2. Camara, every reviewer said the camara performance is good in this device, but it's really just average. The hardware configuration is good I guess but the image processing is really very average. Samsung has to fix this issue in next security updates. If not the mobile model is a big flop.
3. Back design of the mobile is good but comming to front the front Camara design is not a punch hole. It's a outdated design.
4. battery backup is good and it's coming with 6000mag battery.

Out of 5 star below is my honest rating for each segment.

1. Display: 5 out of 5
2. Camara: 1 out of 5
3. Processor: 3 out of 5
4. Speaker: 4 out of 5
5. Battery: 4 out of 5

If you are looking for allrounder performance. Pls do not consider this mobile. Honestly speaking it's nothing at a price point of 16999. Eventhough if it comes for 14999, don't consider this mobile.

My choice on this device is because of camara and display. But the camara is just a big disaster. I'm now waiting for an update to release from samsung which will fix image processing.

Over all its 2 out of 5 from my end."

1. It does not have hardware support for common VP9 and AV1 codecs (just support H.264 and H.265)
2. Wifi Antenna is single (can easily give 2 antenna)
3. Wifi Direct is not present in sharing menu.
4. 5G consumes lot of heat and high battery usage
5. Easily gets hot under normal load
6. Camera Quality could have been better given 50 mp camera.
7. RAM is 6GB but older apps go out of memory if you open more than 2 apps.

- For normal usage the battery can last up to 2 days.

First is lagging issue: UI responds little slow and lags frequently while using apps. Even while receiving or dailing calls. Forget about gaming. This is definitely the worst phone in mid range.
Issue with connectivity: while using calls, facing frequent connectivity issues for calls as well as while browsing.

Lags in connecting internet and loading pages. Major disadvantage is heating during charging. Felt phone is heating without charging also.

* If I receive a phone call while I am using other apps, the other end cannot hear my voice. There seems to some issue with microphone when other apps are in use.

Not able to detect 5GHZ connections. Even broadband speed is low compared to other phones like M31, which is 3 years old and cheaper. This is a big letdown as internet is something that's on all the time. Rest of the things seem to be fine.

4 years OS updates and 5 years security updates at this price range is awesome.

People complaining about no charger did not know how to order. I got free charger."

Hassle to activate / deactivate lots of simple features that require only single or couple of touch in other brands like Realme. Only 3 fingerprints can be added. Split screen functionality / transitions are very inconvenient

- the phone doesn't have extra tray for microSD card. 2nd SIM and microSD card share same tray, so you can insert either one of them.
- the phone is comparatively heavy, probably because of it's bigger battery.
- transfer data thru Samsung smart switch is not that convenient.
- considering screen, network, etc it's an average phone. Much overhyped in market."

I have placed return or replace request as camara quality is not good and it was assigned to a technician to check the mobile physically but he had not come to our place .when we called him he said he can't come and asked us to share the 4 digit number of the order and placed for refund. He said courier boy will come and take the mobile. Money will be returned in 1 or 2 days..we have waited for 2 to 3 days but no action. We called to customer service and they said that refund request was not placed then we realized that he made us fool just to escape from the work. Then they said need to place same request again and technician has to check the phone then only can place refund request...I had already lost 4 days of time and again they are giving us same solution..I have asked them for alternative solution he said he will check and asked me to stay on line for 2 min then no body was on line and call got disconnected after few min.. I had spent almost 30min to explain the problem to the customer service team but no luck..they just disconnected the call without providing any solution...irresponsible team and they don't care abt customer satisfaction...now I am unable to place any request..

Plz don't waste your money!!!,"1. Just after 12 days of use, the display has been damaged but without any physical damage on screen (able to receive calls but screen looks blank only) since it has dropped from fridge. When I visited a Samsung store it won't be cover under free warranty, they said. I had to spend another 6200/- for changing the display only. Earlier I used to use M31 moblie. That was slipped many times but the phone ran nearly 3 years. After that I had to switch from M31 to M 34 5G mobile.
2. Phone is getting heat while usage. It is major concern. too much heat observed while phone gets charge.
3. It takes nearly 1:30 hr to 1:50 hr to fully charge.
4. Even the Samsung service also worst, they kept my mobile with them for 7 hours and they were saying that the display stock is not available. It will take 7 days of time. That too they said this thing when I was calling them. Even they did not inform me this info From their end. I had to call and wasted a day time. I never see such a worst Samsung service certer especially ""Kompally branch"".
4. I purchased this phone for its amoled display but now I realised that this is a not a strong display.
5. Please don't waste your money on spending this mobile. Basically I am a big fan of Samsung. I used M21 and M31. After 2 years M21 had a display and motherboard issues but M 31 ran for nearly 3 years. If you are a Samsung lover, go for any other models except SAMSUNG M31 5G."

Got it delivered in UP for my friends relative.
Battery draining from day 1 and phone is heating up. Called the technician but he bluffed us and said the phone is faulty and he will get it replaced and refunded . And took the New phone In his hand and was installing some app and said it is done now.
Later had to call Amazon customer server and they said technician cannot place return request and I will do it for you. And the return was also not done and again had to call Amazon executive and raise an investigation and today came to know from the customer care that the technical team said that there is no issue with the mobile and nothing cannot be done..
Such a pathetic service by Amazon and it feels sad to he cheated by such big company.

While delivery, I was asked to verify the exchange from Amazon App. Some new option against exchange order, where we are asked to key in 6 digits number ( this is not OTP we receive, this we receive from delivery agent) to verify old phone and this step must be done from old phone Amazon App. All good so far, i could see that verification option in my samsung S20 phone. When I tried in old phone Android 10 that particular option is not there. Installed Amazon app multiple times the options is not there.
Delivery Agent refused to accept the exchange.

I called customer care, they were not aware of these options and I have to explain several times. Had multiple call no solution yet.

At one point they asked for the screenshot of that option, by that time order status marked as delivery attempted and that option is no more visible in latest phone as well. I couldn't share the screenshot as well.

Very bad experience, I could not gift as planned.

It is purely Amazon App issue, but we are suffering.

So that by researching among most of the products in this price range i chose m34. And to mention that this is my first samsung product. But very disappointed with battery in this device. Actually it feels like 5000mah ( Note: Even in all the settings in low ) Maximum i turned off all the features which drains battery. In that case also the battery backup is same and worst. And also battery drains in idle state without any background process and while mobile data, wifi, bluetooth etc.. in off. I tested it very keenly. If you are looking for best battery backup i would not suggest you this device, better to go with 5000mah in this same price range. Amazon service also very disappointed. I looked for a replacement or return for this product but it is not available."

Pro: 1.Display is very good, 2.battery backup full day although draining fast.
3. Sound is clear
4. 5G reception OK.
5. Can copy data from old phone ( contact, sms, photos appps etc) so no data loss if shifting SIM to it.
Cons: 1. Below average camera, even old J7 and J3 was better in normal photo click, paid reviewer made hype thats why I bought this phone but believe me all is myth and false. Video is good but normal or portrait photos is below average, it's not for camera lovers. Even it can't click a good pic of 50 meters far board (not readable) or an calender in room. I compared it with realme narzo 60, samsung j7, realme XT, vivo T2, one plus nord CE2 and it only equalize J7. All other phones camera was far better than this. I'm regretting for buying this. Couldn't imagine this type of bad camera in a phone of 15000.
2. Slightly heavy
2. Heating.
3. Cost me extra 1500 for charger, tempered glass and cover."

However, we've encountered a significant issue with overheating that has made the phone almost unusable. The device gets so hot that my mother can't even hold it in her hand, and out of concern for safety, we've resorted to keeping it on the floor, fearing it might explode.

We reached out to Amazon's customer support immediately, expressing our worries about this potentially hazardous situation. They scheduled a technician to visit within a 4-hour slot, but to our disappointment, the technician never showed up and required my availability. Despite waiting for two days, we didn't receive any follow-up communication. Taking matters into my own hands, I contacted customer support again, only to be told that they won't replace the phone until a technician assesses it.

This entire experience has been frustrating and disappointing. The lack of professionalism displayed by Amazon's customer service and the ongoing issue with the phone's heating have left us greatly dissatisfied. We hope Amazon will take swift action to address these concerns and provide a solution as soon as possible."

1. Very Poor Performance
2. Shake Camera not working properly (All videos Shaking)
3. Mobile Over Heating issues
4. Apps are opened quickly (Hanging issues)
5. Samsung's Customer care side also no proper solution above listed issues.
6. Refresh rating also very poor, I think refresh rating below 90hz.
7. Other Company give Good Performance mobile, Smooth refresh rating, Big Display, No Lagging & Hanging issues, 33W or 45W adaptor, Cable, Temper Glasses & Back Cover provided. But Samsung cheating with all Customers. Very bad experience & disappointed.

So, please return my mobile and give my refund. I will go to purchase other company mobile.

But totally disappointed with the amazon service.
They displayed the offer that you will get a coupon worth the Samsung 25 watt charger amount on purchasing the phone in prime day sale.
But I didn't received any reward on reaching out serveral time( quite exausting experience) wasted hours of time, repeating and explaining the issue to every executive, they didn't resolved my issue saying that there was no such offer although I have shared the screenshot of the offer which I am claiming about.
I have read that alot of other customers also faced this issue(haven't received charger for pre booked offer).

I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED THE PHONE WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE OFFER ALSO, BUT NOT HAPPY WITH THE SCAM YOU PEOPLE ARE DOING.

Update: went to a service centre they declared it to be defective sealed packed it and asked to raise replacement(window is of 14 days) . On calling Amazon customer care they have asked to wait for 8 days for further update.
Called amazon and samsung service centre atleast 10 times today, whole day was traumatic.

Things I have noticed in my last 3weeks use:
1. This has complimentary network issues which is the most annoying part.
2. Extremely heating issues.
3. After you skip YouTube ads the video will never play untill you come back and retry without ads.
4. Speaker sound is loud but worse than roadside speakers
5. Camera also have not met my expectations.
6. Haven't got any new device feelings, worse than my old handset.

Only good thing about the phone is its backside shade. That's good.

*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***

Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.

Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.

I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performance

Front and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.

Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.

Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.

Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.

Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.

Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average üòÜ but manageable if you have back cover.

Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.
Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.

I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.

Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.

As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.

If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.

But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.

In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.
I couldn't find a phone which has:

Super AmoLed Bright display.
6000 mAh battery.
OIS camera.
120hz Refresh Rate.
4 years of OS (stock Android like) updates
Decent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)
5G with several bands.

It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.

Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.

Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.

Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.

Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.

Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.

Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.

Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.

If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.

I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.

Overall a nice deal !"

I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.

( After 3 months am updating the review again below)

October Update: -
During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ‚Çπ14200 rs with card discount

My requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.

Cons or Disadvantages: -
1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)

2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.

3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic. Using Snapchat filter for good selfie
One more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.
Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile camera
Back camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there

4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available
5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .
After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds

6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respond

No more cons I found till date. I ll update later.

Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )

2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it

3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.

4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)
Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.

5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug in

Suggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.

If your priorities is display and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )

Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)

Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‚ÄòHonest Review ‚Äô upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.

Thank you...‚ù§Ô∏è"

this is Sourya Gourab,
today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......
üëâ... PROS ...üëà
‚ñ™Ô∏è1) CAMERA:- the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .üëç
‚ñ™Ô∏è 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....üëç but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...ü§î honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.
‚ñ™Ô∏è3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thingüî•ü•∞. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure FolderüìÅ etc. Samsung Knoxüîí is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung üòçüòçüòç
‚ñ™Ô∏è4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot üî• Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue üòäüòäit's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.
üëâ Yes!! sometimes it feels warmüî• in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad üòä. ‚Çπ14999/- is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......üëçüëçüëç
‚ñ™Ô∏è5) BATTERYüîã:- 6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.
But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.üëç prevent background running of apps etc.....
‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èüëâ... CON'S ...üëà‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è
‚ñ™Ô∏è6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also highüìà. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damagesüòÖ in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!! KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
2:) Phone has slightly warmüå° issue on its back side....also Slightly Heatüî• during charging.....üòê but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG üòáüòáüòá
SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....
I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ‚ù§Ô∏è. Regards

The color midnight blue looks absolutely stunning. Very easy to setup and seamless data transferring from the old device.
The size of the phone is handy and not too big or small, I would the perfect size.
For the display all I need to say is that it is a Samsung display. Such a vibrant and good looking display, love it.
Didn't face any kind of lag or stuttering, the ram management is also pretty good.
The cameras too are pretty decent, daylight photography would yield good photos and in night the quality would go down but still so much better than other phones in this segment. Loved the cameras too üí•
The updates too are amazing, 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of security updates.
Speakers are loud too, with a decent amount of bass and clarity.
5g works well if you live in a metropolitan area, where 5g is available throughout.
The phone feels sturdy and durable.

Now why not 5 stars...
1) the phone gets hot, use too much camera the phone will get hot, use the phone for a really long time 3-4 hours it will get hot even in the winters.
2) the design is not the latest but will suffice. Still Samsung should have given a punch hole display."

Pros-
1.Its good for people with concern of battery backup as it has 1.5 to 2 day backup.

2.You should prefer 8gb 128gb minimum variant as there will be 4 OS updates and to handle that 8gb minimum ram should be required.

3.Also, camera quality is good and on top of that 120 hz Amoled Full Hd+ display is top notch.

Cons-
1. Not suitable for high end gaming , you can play games but not at highest graphics , standard graphics is preferred.

2.Some time get overheated due to excessive gaming or playing at high resoluion.

3. Fingerprint sensor is not that fast but decent."

Have also purchased A7 & A10 for a family member. I was looking to buy a mid range phone and this is one of the best phones in mid range prices with 4 Android and 5 yrs security updates. Samsung is known for a good display and awesome cameras however this device scores low as per my expectations. Another plus is powerful battery which lasts for more than a day if the usage is normal. One of the BIGGEST drawback, it's heavy and thicker as compared to the current generation of smartphones and may discourage buyers. So if you are looking for lighter and thinner phones, this may not be the right phone for you."

Size feels big but it is normal these days all smartphone have almost same size. Touce responce is good 120hz feel super smooth don't swith to 60hz it kills the smoothness. I don't know about Durabitity , samsung promise for 4yrs os update but i don't think it can handle it.

OIS Camera is better than other phones at this price. But not good as s21 fe and apple 7 plus. Broken Pixels are seen on zoom in pics. Video recording is good one.
2. 6000mah battery is best if you disable 5g connectivity. M34 uses 5nm processor which consumes less battery. Charging takes around 2 hours 20 minutes.
3. Worth at 15k price. No difference is seen between 120hz and 60hz refresh rate."

1.Battery life is good. Easily works whole day with high usage.
2.Security and updates are good
3.Audio quality is good .

Cons:
1. Very heavy in weight
2. Very bad ,literally pathetic selfie ( front) camera
3.If you have used xiomi, redmi or oppo or any other phones in the past ,you will miss their camera and video quality. Very bad video quality.

2. Display? 120 hz super amoled. More than enough.
3. Software? One UI 5.1 flagship level. All features and customization available. With good lock you get everything. Android 13 out of the box.
4. Updates? 4 years OS + 5 years security. More than enough
5. Knox security.
6. Samsung wallet with nfc.
7. Simple. Durable.
8. If you compare with other Chinese phones, goes are assembled phone. But Samsung has its own chipset(not the best one), camera sensors(good), display(very good) hence these very well co-ordinated.

Phone seems to stutter rarely not so frequent can be ignored. If you set your expectations in check then this won't disappoint you. There are few bloatwares of samsung but most of them can be uninstalled, rest can be disabled. Buy this if you don't want any other unreliable company's phone.

Inflation affects a lot.
So, Buy only 8GB+256GB variant because hybrid simslot and no esim support buy 8GB+256GB which only make sense.

Connectivity- 5G is stable I tested with Airtel 5g and speed is awesome.

Heating- No heating issue

Performence- Phone performs smoothly in all apps. Sometimes jitters at the time of heavy multitasking. This phone is not for high end gaming

Camera- The best camera under 20k

Battery - Battery is 6000 mah but it feels like 5000, It's okay normal.

Display- No comparison in display, it's awesome

One ui- The full one ui is so much usefully in daily office tasks. It packs uncountable features for you.

Else everything is perfect 6000mh massive battery and super amoled display 120hz refresh rate, tested Exynos 1280 SoC,chipset which offers you major 4 updates ,if you are heavy gamer,then these will not for you. For normal gamming it's been quite study .camera is upto the mark.with ..
And moreover it's a made in India product..not such typical chines phones.....connectivity and performance of 5g bands are decent. Exynos 1280 SoC, chipset for havy tasking might get heating issue..Hopefully upcoming updates may resolved such issues...otherwise it's a capable processor."

No doubt about it, but on YouTube it can play only 1080p video, not even my YouTube premium 1080p enhanced bitrate video. So, I'm having clarity issue on YouTube.
* Don't have wifi 6, which is a con.
* Doesn't support VoNR, which is also a con.
* Doesn't has charger in the box and neither stereo speaker.
* I don't play games, so performance is good for me.
* Side mounted fingerprint, which works properly, and it justified in this price point.
* Camera is good.
* Overall you're paying some extra for Samsung brand value."

It has a very crisp 120 hz super amoled display which pops every content that you watch in this mobile. The battery backup was not that great for 6000 mah( maybe because 5g consumes more battery than in a 4g network) , for me it would give only one day of backup after heavily using it. The charging speed is also very great. Charges 1 to 100 in less than a hour. The processesor is not meant for gaming and gets a little heatted up while multitasking. Faced network issue once in a week but not very often but if you face this issue you can just change network mode.( because its common in 5g phones)."

Pros

Let's First talk about camera and screen the main highlights of screen
They all appreciated camera alot but it's not even close to hype gives yellowish tone to each photo like a cheap smartphone not eyepleasing at all
Display is good acc to price but you can tell the difference only when put side to side with another smartphone otherwise all display gives similar view in this price range
So not worth buying only for display

Now price i bought it for 15000
So I should be comparing it with other 15000rs smartphones but not you should go for Smartphone around 17000 because 15000‚Çπ for smartphone + 1500 for charger + 200 cover and screen guard= 16700 ( other brands give all this with smartphone)

So all the best things about this phone camera display price , in actual are not that good all this is gimmick so only buy this phone for your parents who doesn't have long screentime as it has big battery, 4 years of updates

Cons
Took 2 hours too charge that's is way too long
Processor is not that good as you already know
Not worth the price there are better option in less price
Ugly drop notch chin ( though Mobile looks good you may call somewhat premium if chin is ignored)

If you are getting this with charger under 15k and not that fond of gaming and whitish photos ( pictures that makes you look fair) then you can go for it"

But the delivery person couldn't delivered it. He gave one ring missed call at 10 pm and put attempted in delivery status on oct 12 and oct 14 also.

* Gaming phone
* High performance phone

Performs day to day tasks with ease and may be basic gaming.

Call quality is decent.

What is Good:
* Amoled display
* Dolby Atmos
* HIGHLY OPTIMISED phone - so battery lasts longer not just because of bigger battery.
* 6000 Mah battery - Depending upon usage, it can easily last 1.5 day and upto 2 days
* Decent camera
* Few bloatware
* 4yrs OS update and 5 yrs security update (but not sure if the phone can handle 3rd or the 4th OS update)
* Screen brightess is Good and viewable under direct sunlight.
* No in screen finger print scanner - Meaning if for some reason you have to replace the screen, it will be slightly less expensive. Amoled screens with fingerprint scanner will cost you half your phones price

What to expect:
* From time to time you may notice slowness/lag - If you have too many apps installed
* Not intended for high memory utilizing apps
* Slight Heating issues from time to time
* Slow charging if you don't use Samsung fast charger. Tried 33W fast charger - charging is still slow.
* May not be able to handle Android OS 15 or later updates
* Videos can be viewed at maximum resolution of 1080P. Does not support 1220p or 1440P.
* Has only single stereo speaker
* It's better not to charge the phone when it's hot, charging will be slow even with Samsung charger.

Note: It's an old chipset known for heating issues. The same chipset was used in Samsung M33. The only reason it works well, is because the OS is highly optimised.

The phone is for those users:
a) Who performs basic to medium tasks/activities.
b) Stable phone with regular OS updates and security patches
c) Intends to use the phone for 3+yrs

If you do decide to buy this phone, I would recommend you to go with 8GB ram else go for something else.

It seems like a great phone with so many features, a lot them I may never even use. But for the gadget freak, these may thrill. I like the clarity and response of the screen, the camera and the battery life. What I don't like are the weight of the phone and the fact that the cameras juts out by a few mm, making is absolutely necessary to have a case, which makes it even more bulky that it already is.. But overall a nice phone and is good value for money."

First of all, all Samsung bloatwate Apps are the most irritating and disturbing, because you already have far far better Apps for each of your tasks!

The only positive sides are - (1) 8 GB memory (earlier I had 6 GB memory), (2) 5G instead of 4G, and (3) 6000 MaH battery (earlier I had 5000 MaH).

The phone has serious design flaw.

(1)The fingerprint scanner is at the side of the phone instead of on-screen. I bought a back-cover for the phone and now the fingerprint scanner is totally covered by the back cover. I am facing extreme difficulty in logging in to my secure apps and office apps.

(2) The sim tray can accommodate either 2 sim cards, or 1 sim card and 1 memory card. In my earlier phone - Galaxy A71, I could insert 2 sims and 1 memory card in one tray. That is gone now.

(3) The phone does not even support e-sim feature. This is now very common in every phone in this price segment.

(4) Overheating. It heats up even when I put it on charging.

Overall, I feel my money is not well utilized."

Using 30w fast charger, but takes long to get fully charged. The cable provided with the phone is with type C jack at both the ends; really don't understand it's purpose.
