*** Honest review of Samsung Galaxy M34 5G 8GB RAM ***

Super AmoLED display quality is like makkhan/butter and you won't get disappointed and graphic colors are good. Screen is brighter and text shown on display is sharp and crisp.

Refresh does little slow for default apps like YouTube or FB scrolling but kind of ignorable. But rest you will see superb performance when you switch to apps/folders/galleries/videos/widgets etc everything feels smooth.

I used Snapdragon chipset phones and never felt any slowness/jitterness/lagging/hanging problem in this model. I am not a gaming time-waster so I don't know about its gaming performance

Front and rear OIS camera photos are natural and vivid. It will not process images how Chinese brands shows artificial beauty but maintain natural colours.

Good work in terms of weight management as you would never feel heavy at all.

Sometimes slowness when switching from mobile data to wifi or vice versa.

Fast battery drain when you share your internet through hotspot.

Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Full day battery back up when you continue use everything includes continue WIFI, social media, YouTube etc. Otherwise 1.5 day for average use.

Suitable for winter season because it heats a little more than average üòÜ but manageable if you have back cover.

Speakers are sharp and well built which produce sharp sound quality.
Slow charging is a myth. I can see it's getting charged little faster than people are telling in reviews.

Exact size temper glass may not fix as it's display edges are slight curved which results in passing air in the gap of temper glass which gets removed/unstick. Use smaller width temper glass than the phone screen.

I don't know why the drop-notch is paining the reviewers. For me, it's not a matter of concern. Samsung has 1 feature to adjust the display so the screen will appear little below the notch to avoid any distraction while playing videos. Yes it's little old design but one doesn't have to follow every new design that launches every few months. Otherwise one can go for invisible camera which is hidden inside the display if you want to follow the trend.

Good good those who are comfortable in side mount fingerprint sensor than the in-display fingerprint.

As it has 4 years of Android OS updates then recommended to opt for 8 GB RAM.

If you want a full fledged decent phone with bundles of software feature and strong hardware package that can work for a long time and you don't have time to spend on researching about models every few months then this is a must buy model.

But if you want to stick to the trend where every 3 months there are newer models with new gimmick designs/features then you can ignore this phone. Also this may not be good gaming people.

In spite of all these pros and cons, I think it's justifiable for the price when compare to other models with exact same features.
I couldn't find a phone which has:

Super AmoLed Bright display.
6000 mAh battery.
OIS camera.
120hz Refresh Rate.
4 years of OS (stock Android like) updates
Decent chipset for multi tasking (except gaming)
5G with several bands.

It's an almost flagship level phone as you have same features of Samsung flagship phones.

Other Competitors: iQoo Z7s, Motorola Edge 20 Fusion, OnePlus Nord 3 CE Lite, Realme Narzo 60 5G, Realme 11 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 12, Vivo T2,"

It's a good phone for every day use ,it's not a gaming phone so don't expect a very great performance in this section.

Camera is okay types. Back cameras don't disappoint but sometimes you will fill that the software over kills the shots. Front camera is so so nothing really great about that. Both these cameras need sufficient light to produce acceptable quality photos. Low light photography is not so that great, but it's same with most of the phones except if it's pixel series phone. One more thing the main back camera is OIS but i dint felt it's presence while using camera :)) and don't expect too much from the camera app it's just okay type , digital zoom is useless... on all the phones.

Battery last for nearly 1.5 days if used lightly, if you are heavy user it will easily last for one day. Charger is not provided with the phone you need original Samsung 25W charger to get the best of phone's battery n this charger. It takes nearly 1.5 hours to fully charge his phone with this 25W fast charger.The phone n charger both gets warm while charging n it's something that is expected during fast charging.

Phone's hardware is loaded for day to day usage n the supplied softwares need some sorting to remove the unnecessary softwares that comes with the boxed unit.

Coming to phone's ergonomic... it's a very slippery phone so before you get the phone..get a back cover, Amazon's basic silicone cover seems a natural choice for this phone. Media n finger print scanner is mounted on right side of the phone n works very fast.

Display is good ! You get 3.5 mm jack , radio with Samsung's software.output speaker is mono but quite load and clear.

Phone is good with 5G networks, you will see dramatic download speeds on these networks,I'm using it on Airtel 5G n it's performing well on this network.

If battery life is critical to your usage, keep the phone in power saving mode.

I got this phone for 18.5k for the 8/128GB config, after all the card discount. I was not sure about Samsung cuz all this year's I never used a Samsung device but this time I seriously wanted to avoid chinese phone. There are 100s of phone in this segment even Samsung M/A series has many phones in this segment, but I took a risk as it was just launched n I'm not regretting my decision as I mainly use this phone for net browsing, emails, reading PDFs ,chats and camera.

Overall a nice deal !"

I am Satisfied with this phone. ( Suggest to read all the cons and disadvantages first I have mentioned)I got it at 16999 + 1000 (for adaptor) on first sale. Because I did not pre book.

( After 3 months am updating the review again below)

October Update: -
During the big billion day sale this mobile price was go down to around ‚Çπ14200 rs with card discount

My requirements was A good Display and good Battery backup and Good Camera only because I don't play Games . So I prefer Samsung inspite of the myth told by my friends Samsung mobile get hangs and camera is not good.

Cons or Disadvantages: -
1) Front design ( After 1-2 years you ll feel low as everyone ll have punch hole display)

2) Battery is 6000mAh but I feel like 5000 mAh battery backup It will give 1 Day battery backup in normal use For heavy user may be needed to charge twice I can Say If you charge 2 times it will give you 1.5 days backup.

3) Front camera Should be 16 Mp inspite of 13mp.But you ll get clarity pic (photos r natural ) . Average pic. Using Snapchat filter for good selfie
One more cons ,while I click shutter button for photo Sometime it take little more time to respond.
Portrait mode is totally bad like below 10k range mobile camera
Back camera also not upto the mark only Ois is there

4 ) No in display 3 fingers screenshot available
5) Am getting some network issue First I thought for 5g connectivity but sometimes with 4g also .. No clarity video call . Before I was using infinix note 5 that was more better than this .
After doing the data on its taking sometime to get internet connection back like 5-10 seconds

6)After 3 months with 80 % storage full am getting another issue like while calling someone it's taking 3-5 seconds late to respond

No more cons I found till date. I ll update later.

Pros - 1) 120HZ Amoled Display is amazing ( As we know We know Even iPhone Use Samsung display) I compete it with Real me GT 2 Display but Samsung Won )

2)Camera is OIS but not upto the mark you have to manage with it

3) Performance and Speed is very fast you won't feel like exonos processor is used. Apps also open so quickly.

4) A lots of features has given by Samsung.( Some iPhone features too)
Like Screen and Call recording,All Sensor ,lot of Photo editing feature like Erase the object etc.

5) Charging time approximately 1 hour 30 minutes u can see I have uploaded a screenshot during the charge plug in

Suggestions: Buy a good Backcover first because phone is very glassy and slippery.

If your priorities is display and battery ( remember you have to do manage with camera )you can go for it as it also provides 4 years software updates. But ( After 3 months no major update I have found till October )

Don't buy by reading my review only it's better to take average people's review to account to take decision)

Am going to upload a full review video on a new YT channel name ‚ÄòHonest Review ‚Äô upcoming so that you can get the complete information and ask me more questions regarding it.

Thank you...‚ù§Ô∏è"

this is Sourya Gourab,
today I'll give my honest review on Galaxy M34 5G after using 5 days. Here are some explanations with pro's and cons. So read all before purchasing......
üëâ... PROS ...üëà
‚ñ™Ô∏è1) CAMERA:- the main focus for this phone is it's '4K OIS' camera which is main feature. In my use I'll say yes camera is good and portrait photos are also good in this price point. No one will give this feature. Even 13mp selfie is more clear and bright as compare to those Chinese phones. For a better camera go for it .üëç
‚ñ™Ô∏è 2) 120Hrz sAmoled DISPLAY:- Everybody know that, in the field of display, no one can beat Samsung. In my use, I have played Prime Video Movies, Youtube, display quality super....üëç but use tempered glass because there is a compromise in build quality that I noticed ...ü§î honestly saying....it's the sad truth. if you will not use external glass, there is a risk of damage by normal drop from hand.
‚ñ™Ô∏è3) Software and Security:- in just 15k, you are getting ONE UI full version (not core)....which is a great thingüî•ü•∞. The king in Android world One UI has many security features like Secure FolderüìÅ etc. Samsung Knoxüîí is OSM. far better than those Chinese vulnerable phones.....also in term of update, no one can beat samsung. NFC, Dobly Atmos....etc are premium features in samsung üòçüòçüòç
‚ñ™Ô∏è4) PROCESSOR:- Well the ""Exynos 1280"" 5nm SOC is not bad as people say, its now updated but still it's not recommendable for heavy uses. It will hang and heat a lot üî• Never use it for gaming... it's good for day to day tasks like Content watching on OTT, Social Media, Email and web Browsing, online Shopping etc.....there is no problem and in normal use there is no such major heating issue üòäüòäit's completely fine. But again I'm saying that if you want phone for gaming and heavy uses, then go with IQOO phones available on Amazon at best price. like Neo7 and Neo7 pro.
üëâ Yes!! sometimes it feels warmüî• in backide but I'll say it's not normal and not bad üòä. ‚Çπ14999/- is a killer deal for this. Most go for it......üëçüëçüëç
‚ñ™Ô∏è5) BATTERYüîã:- 6000mAh battery used in this device, it's backup is good but not at that level of marketing which is explained on paper ..... it will give you 7-8 hrs screen on time in 85% of charge with normal use. Highest 10 hrs.
But you can do some important settings to increase it's battery life and better optimise the phone.üëç prevent background running of apps etc.....
‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èüëâ... CON'S ...üëà‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è
‚ñ™Ô∏è6) BUILD QUALITY:- It's build quality is not good.....Everyone know that Samsung gives good build quality in it's A series phones so their prices are also highüìà. And the only compromise and cost cutting is it's ""Build quality"" . A normal drop from normal hight may cause damagesüòÖ in your phone....so don't worry, always use Protective Glass and strong Cover.....otherwise!!!!!! KHATAM ...TATA...BYBY....GODBYE...GAYA ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
2:) Phone has slightly warmüå° issue on its back side....also Slightly Heatüî• during charging.....üòê but it's not a major point...because it's not always.... Samsung should optimise this otherwise it will not good........ And I hope it Will be more stabled in upcoming updates...because after August patch, Phone is more optimised and stabled. So we have that strong faith on SAMSUNG üòáüòáüòá
SO..... this was my opinions.... choice is yours....
I hope it will help you. That's my pleasure. Thank you Amazon ‚ù§Ô∏è. Regards

The color midnight blue looks absolutely stunning. Very easy to setup and seamless data transferring from the old device.
The size of the phone is handy and not too big or small, I would the perfect size.
For the display all I need to say is that it is a Samsung display. Such a vibrant and good looking display, love it.
Didn't face any kind of lag or stuttering, the ram management is also pretty good.
The cameras too are pretty decent, daylight photography would yield good photos and in night the quality would go down but still so much better than other phones in this segment. Loved the cameras too üí•
The updates too are amazing, 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of security updates.
Speakers are loud too, with a decent amount of bass and clarity.
5g works well if you live in a metropolitan area, where 5g is available throughout.
The phone feels sturdy and durable.

Now why not 5 stars...
1) the phone gets hot, use too much camera the phone will get hot, use the phone for a really long time 3-4 hours it will get hot even in the winters.
2) the design is not the latest but will suffice. Still Samsung should have given a punch hole display."

Pros-
1.Its good for people with concern of battery backup as it has 1.5 to 2 day backup.

2.You should prefer 8gb 128gb minimum variant as there will be 4 OS updates and to handle that 8gb minimum ram should be required.

3.Also, camera quality is good and on top of that 120 hz Amoled Full Hd+ display is top notch.

Cons-
1. Not suitable for high end gaming , you can play games but not at highest graphics , standard graphics is preferred.

2.Some time get overheated due to excessive gaming or playing at high resoluion.

3. Fingerprint sensor is not that fast but decent."

Have also purchased A7 & A10 for a family member. I was looking to buy a mid range phone and this is one of the best phones in mid range prices with 4 Android and 5 yrs security updates. Samsung is known for a good display and awesome cameras however this device scores low as per my expectations. Another plus is powerful battery which lasts for more than a day if the usage is normal. One of the BIGGEST drawback, it's heavy and thicker as compared to the current generation of smartphones and may discourage buyers. So if you are looking for lighter and thinner phones, this may not be the right phone for you."

Size feels big but it is normal these days all smartphone have almost same size. Touce responce is good 120hz feel super smooth don't swith to 60hz it kills the smoothness. I don't know about Durabitity , samsung promise for 4yrs os update but i don't think it can handle it. Battery is not so good it takes around 1hr 30 min(25w official charger) to full charge and gives around 6 to 7 hr (5g and 120hz enabled) screen on time."

1.Battery life is good. Easily works whole day with high usage.
2.Security and updates are good
3.Audio quality is good .

Cons:
1. Very heavy in weight
2. Very bad ,literally pathetic selfie ( front) camera
3.If you have used xiomi, redmi or oppo or any other phones in the past ,you will miss their camera and video quality. Very bad video quality.
4.Hear echo on calls most of the times.
6. No charger and dont get good back covers for this phone in market.

Overall very average phone. Regret buying this at 22000 ."

OIS Camera is better than other phones at this price. But not good as s21 fe and apple 7 plus. Broken Pixels are seen on zoom in pics. Video recording is good one.
2. 6000mah battery is best if you disable 5g connectivity. M34 uses 5nm processor which consumes less battery. Charging takes around 2 hours 20 minutes.
3. Worth at 15k price. No difference is seen between 120hz and 60hz refresh rate."

1. Battery? Yes. 6000 mah. Will comfortably work for 36+ hrs. SOT(about 10 hrs). It has Battery protect feature. More than enough.
2. Display? 120 hz super amoled. More than enough.
3. Software? One UI 5.1 flagship level. All features and customization available. With good lock you get everything. Android 13 out of the box.
4. Updates? 4 years OS + 5 years security. More than enough
5. Knox security.
6. Samsung wallet with nfc.
7. Simple. Durable.
8. If you compare with other Chinese phones, goes are assembled phone. But Samsung has its own chipset(not the best one), camera sensors(good), display(very good) hence these very well co-ordinated.
9. I almost forgot, camera is good.
10. Phone is not for pro gamers.
11. No heating."

Pros

Let's First talk about camera and screen the main highlights of screen
They all appreciated camera alot but it's not even close to hype gives yellowish tone to each photo like a cheap smartphone not eyepleasing at all
Display is good acc to price but you can tell the difference only when put side to side with another smartphone otherwise all display gives similar view in this price range
So not worth buying only for display

Now price i bought it for 15000
So I should be comparing it with other 15000rs smartphones but not you should go for Smartphone around 17000 because 15000‚Çπ for smartphone + 1500 for charger + 200 cover and screen guard= 16700 ( other brands give all this with smartphone)

So all the best things about this phone camera display price , in actual are not that good all this is gimmick so only buy this phone for your parents who doesn't have long screentime as it has big battery, 4 years of updates

Cons
Took 2 hours too charge that's is way too long
Processor is not that good as you already know
Not worth the price there are better option in less price
Ugly drop notch chin ( though Mobile looks good you may call somewhat premium if chin is ignored)

If you are getting this with charger under 15k and not that fond of gaming and whitish photos ( pictures that makes you look fair) then you can go for it"

Has some lag issues although my mother is using it so don't know what would have happened if I was using ,then i would be a 2 star rating. The display is perfect but overall not that much . It heats up whenever you charge it"

Phone seems to stutter rarely not so frequent can be ignored. If you set your expectations in check then this won't disappoint you. There are few bloatwares of samsung but most of them can be uninstalled, rest can be disabled. Buy this if you don't want any other unreliable company's phone.

Promised software support is a bit ambitious but lets see how it keeps up with time, as of now updates are not that frequent."

Don't buy if you are gamer, 4k Video watcher on youtube.
But if you are scroller of instagram, facebook and lite gaming.
Then it's good
Camera is good
Not best
Inflation affects a lot.
So, Buy only 8GB+256GB variant because hybrid simslot and no esim support buy 8GB+256GB which only make sense.
Samsung please give us charger also
1k for charger it's a huge price.

In my experience it is a great phone,

Connectivity- 5G is stable I tested with Airtel 5g and speed is awesome.

Heating- No heating issue

Performence- Phone performs smoothly in all apps. Sometimes jitters at the time of heavy multitasking. This phone is not for high end gaming

Camera- The best camera under 20k

Battery - Battery is 6000 mah but it feels like 5000, It's okay normal.

Display- No comparison in display, it's awesome

One ui- The full one ui is so much usefully in daily office tasks. It packs uncountable features for you.

Conclusion- If you are not a gamer and your budget is under 20k than don't think anything go for it."

It has a very crisp 120 hz super amoled display which pops every content that you watch in this mobile. The battery backup was not that great for 6000 mah( maybe because 5g consumes more battery than in a 4g network) , for me it would give only one day of backup after heavily using it. The charging speed is also very great. Charges 1 to 100 in less than a hour. The processesor is not meant for gaming and gets a little heatted up while multitasking.

As charger is not being supplied, still it is bit costly even after price reduction. Battery is loosing power bit fast and mobile is warming up with heavy usage."

* Gaming phone
* High performance phone

Performs day to day tasks with ease and may be basic gaming.

Call quality is decent.

What is Good:
* Amoled display
* Dolby Atmos
* HIGHLY OPTIMISED phone - so battery lasts longer not just because of bigger battery.
* 6000 Mah battery - Depending upon usage, it can easily last 1.5 day and upto 2 days
* Decent camera
* Few bloatware
* 4yrs OS update and 5 yrs security update (but not sure if the phone can handle 3rd or the 4th OS update)
* Screen brightess is Good and viewable under direct sunlight.
* No in screen finger print scanner - Meaning if for some reason you have to replace the screen, it will be slightly less expensive. Amoled screens with fingerprint scanner will cost you half your phones price

What to expect:
* From time to time you may notice slowness/lag - If you have too many apps installed
* Not intended for high memory utilizing apps
* Slight Heating issues from time to time
* Slow charging if you don't use Samsung fast charger. Tried 33W fast charger - charging is still slow.
* May not be able to handle Android OS 15 or later updates
* Videos can be viewed at maximum resolution of 1080P. Does not support 1220p or 1440P.
* Has only single stereo speaker
* It's better not to charge the phone when it's hot, charging will be slow even with Samsung charger.

Note: It's an old chipset known for heating issues. The same chipset was used in Samsung M33. The only reason it works well, is because the OS is highly optimised.

The phone is for those users:
a) Who performs basic to medium tasks/activities.
b) Stable phone with regular OS updates and security patches
c) Intends to use the phone for 3+yrs

If you do decide to buy this phone, I would recommend you to go with 8GB ram else go for something else.

It's a good deal at this price. However it has 6000 mh battery but still stands for a day.I feel 1000 extra is given due to weak processor. U won't get the feeling of 6000 mh. Little heats up while sharing Hotspot and battery drains .
